Apple;Scab:
A Apple scab is a disease caused by the fungus Venturia inaequalis.
It survives the winter mainly on infected leaves on the ground but also on bud scales or lesions on wood.
At the onset of spring, the fungus resumes growth and starts to produce spores, which are later discharged and dispersed over long distances by the wind.
These spores land on developing leaves and fruits and start a new infection. Outer parts of unopened fruit buds are highly susceptible to scab.
However, as the fruit matures it becomes much less susceptible. Humid environment, wetting period of leaves or fruits are essential for the infection.
Alternative hosts include shrubs of the genus Cotoneaster, Pyracantha and Sorbus. All apple varieties are susceptible to scab, with Gala being more vulnerable.
@
If disease levels were high the previous season, liquid copper fungicides can be sprayed to impede the fungal growth on the tree during the winter season.
Sulfur sprays are only partially effective against apple scab. However, solutions containing sulfur and pyrethrins are available for organic control of the disease during the growing season.
Chemical Control
Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments, if available.
#Apple;Black_Rot:
Black rot is caused by the fungus Diplodia seriata (syn Botryosphaeria obtusa).
The fungus can infect dead tissue as well as living trunks, branches, leaves and fruits.
The black rot fungi survive Minnesota winters in branch cankers and mummified fruit (shriveled and dried fruit) attached to the tree.
In wet weather, spores are released from these infections and spread by wind or splashing water.
Leaf spots don’t release fungal spores.
The fungus infects leaves and fruit through natural openings or minor wounds.
Branches and the trunk are most likely to be infected through dead or damaged wood.
Leaf spots don’t seriously affect the health of the tree unless many leaves turn yellow and fall off because of the infection (this is rare).

#Cherry;Powder_Mildew:
Fungal spores overwinter inside leaf buds and other plant debris. Wind, water, and insects transmit the spores to nearby plants. Even though it is a fungus, powdery mildew can develop rather normally in dry conditions.
It survives at temperatures between 10-12°C, but optimal conditions are found at 30°C. In contrast to downy mildew, small amounts of rainfall and regular morning dew accelerate the spreading of powdery mildew.
@
Organic Control
Foliar sprays based on sulfur, neem oil, kaolin or ascorbic acid can prevent severe infection.

Chemical Control
Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. In view of the number of crops that are susceptible to powdery mildew, it is difficult to recommend any particular chemical treatment.
Fungicides based on wettable sulphur (3 g/l), hexaconazole, myclobutanil (all 2 ml/l) seem to control the growth of the fungus in some crops

#Corn;Gray_Leaf_Spot:
The symptoms are caused by the fungi of C. lunatus. The infection can be caused by air bourne conidia and ascospores, rainwater splashing and irrigation, and can also survive in the soil via old crop residues. The disease is common in hot, humid areas, under an optimal temperature range of 24-30°C.

#Corn;Rust:
The disease is caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi. The fungus overwinters in an alternate host (a species of Oxalis) and releases spores during the spring. The spores can be transported over great distances by winds and rain.
They start the infection process when landing on the leaves. Secondary infection from plant to plant can also occur due to wind and rain. The development of the disease is favored by high relative humidities (nearly 100%), dew, rain and cool temperatures between 15 and 20°C (may vary depending on area).
Hot, dry weather will in turn slow or hinder the development of the fungus and the incidence of the disease. It is more a problem in plants used for seed production and sweet corn. Plants cultivated as livestock feed, for industrial products, or to make processed foods are not concerned.

#Corn;Northern_Leaf_Blight:
The fungus overwinters in the soil or on plant debris. Rainfall, night dew, high humidity and moderate temperatures favor the dispersion of the the fungus. Carried by wind or rain splashes it first spreads from the soil onto the lower leaves of young maize plants.
Rainy conditions and poor field practices favor its spread to other plants and within fields. Optimal temperatures for infection are in the range of 18 to 27°C during the growing season. A prolonged period of 6 to 18 hours of leaf wetness are also necessary. Sorghum is another favorite host of the fungus.

The damage is caused by the fungus Phyllosticta ampelicida. The pathogen overwinters in infested shoots or fruit mummies on the grapevine or the soil. The spores will be ejected by light rainfall and then dispersed via wind.
Optimal growth conditions are met at 25°C and 6 hours of constant leaf wetness. The fungus prefers warm and humid weather. Reduced fruit yield.

Organic Control
Immediately after blooming stage you can spray Bacillus thuringiensis.

Chemical Control
Chemical applications are done in a preventive manner. Start spraying roughly two weeks before. bloom with captan + mycobutanil or mancozeb + mycobutanil. Just before the blossoms open you can also use carbaryl or imidcloprid.
Post-bloom spray mancozeb + mycobutanil, imidacloprid or azadirachtin. Ten days after bloom you can also apply a mixture of captan and sulfur on your vines. Because most grape varieties become resistant to the infection three to four weeks after bloom, chemical sprays should be avoided at that time.
#Grape;Black_Measles:
The symptoms are mainly caused by the fungus Togninia minima but other fungi can also be involved (for example Phaeomoniella chlamydospora). The infection actually occurs in younger vines but the symptoms may first become apparent in vineyards after 5-7 years.
The fungi survive the winter in overwintering structures embedded in the woody parts of the vines. During fall to spring rainfall, spores are produced and released and may infect wounds done during dormant pruning. Wounds may remain susceptible to infection for several weeks after pruning.
After a pruning wound is infected, the pathogen establishes a permanent, localized wood infection, which cannot be eradicated by fungicide applications.
@
Organic Control
Soak dormant cuttings for 30 mins in hot water at about 50°C. This treatment is not always effective and must therefore be combined with other methods. Some species of Trichoderma have been used to prevent the infection of pruning wounds, basal ends of propagation material, and graft unions.
This treatment has to be carried out within 24 hours of pruning and again 2 weeks after.

Chemical Control
Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Chemical strategies to control this disease are difficult, since the traditional wound protectants do not penetrate deep enough in the dormant grapevine cuttings to affect the fungi.
Preventive practices are the most effective management approach for all trunk diseases. For example, immediately before grafting, vines can be dipped into specialized waxes containing plant growth regulators or fungicide-impregnated formulations. This encourages graft union callus development while inhibiting fungal contamination.

#Orange;Citrus_Greening:
The symptoms of huanglongbing (HLB) are caused by the bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus. It is transmitted persistently by two psyllid vectors that are omnipresent in the citrus grooves, Diaphorina citri and Trioza erytreae. HLB can be acquired by both nymphs and adults, which can maintain and transmit the disease throughout their 3- to 4-month lifespan. Huanglongbing is systemic and has an incubation period of three months to several years before symptoms are visible. The disease can also be spread through grafting, even though with variable transmission rates.
Seed transmission may also be possible. Other pathologies or disorders also show such a mottling of the leaves. It is thus recommended to send samples of tissues for analysis in laboratories to ascertain the cause.

Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. An appropriate use of insecticides has resulted in good control of the psyllid vectors and thus a limited spread of the disease.
Injection of the antibiotic tetracycline into the trunk of the trees may result in a partial recovery but has to be repeated often to show effect. Tetracycline is phytotoxic and may have adverse effects on the environment. For these reasons, its use has decreased in recent years.
#Peach;Bacterial_Spot:PBS
#Peach;Healthy:PH
#Pepper;Bacterial_Spot:
The symptoms are caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas arboricola, whose common hosts are peach, nectarine, prune, plum, and apricot. It overwinters on buds, cracks of the stem or in leaf scars. In spring, when conditions are favorable, it resumes its growth and colonize the rest of the twigs, exuding bacterial ooze as it does so.
The ooze is dispersed by dropping dew, wind or splashing rain and carried to healthy twigs, fruits and leaves. The natural pores on leaves or the lenticels on bark are the entry points for the bacteria. Warm temperatures (21 to 29 °C) with light rains, heavy dews, and windy weather are most conducive for disease development and spread. By contrast, the growth of the bacterium and the infection process is impaired when the weather is hot and dry. The disease leads to yield losses, which can be very high in some particularly susceptible varieties.

#Tomato;Bacterial_Spot:
Initially small yellow-green lesions appear on young leaves for bacterial spots, whilst bacterial speck causes black spots with a narrow yellow halo. They are usually more numerous on leaf margins or tips, which may appear deformed and twisted. In severe cases, the spots of bacterial speck may coalesce or overlap, resulting in larger and irregular lesions. Bacterial spot lesions can enlarge from 0.25 cm to 0.5 cm and become tan to brownish-red, which will eventually look like shot holes when the center dries up. Bacterial spot produces similar lesion of fruits as it does on the leaves and eventually roughen, becoming brown and scabbed. Bacterial speck causes tiny, slightly raised black specks. It is difficult to distinguish between these two diseases at an early stage.
@
Organic Control
Bacterial Spot is very difficult to control and also expensive to treat. If the disease occurs early in the season, consider destroying the entire crop. Copper-containing bactericides provide a protective cover on foliage and fruit for both bacteria. Bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) that specifically kill the bacteria are available for the bacterial spot. Submerging seeds for one minute in 1.3% sodium hypochlorite or in hot water (50°C) for 25 minutes can reduce the incidence of both diseases.

#Tomato;Leaf_Mold:
Symptoms commonly occur on both sides of the foliage and sometimes on fruit. Older leaves are infected first and then the disease slowly moves up towards young leaves. On the upper leaf surface, small, diffuse, pale green or yellowish spots with indefinite margins appear. On the underside, olive green to grayish purple and velvety patches develop below the leaf spots. These are composed of spore-producing structures and spore masses (conidia). Over time, as the spots enlarge, the color of the infected leaf changes from yellowish (chlorosis) to brown (necrosis) and the leaf begins to curl and dry. The leaves will drop prematurely, leading to defoliation in severe cases. Occasionally, this pathogen causes disease on the blossoms or fruits with various symptoms. The blossoms may turn black and will be killed before the fruit sets. Green and ripe fruits will develop a smooth black irregular area on the stem end. As the disease progresses, the infected area becomes sunken, dry and leathery.
@
Organic Control
Seed treatment with hot water (25 minutes at 122 °F or 50 °C) is recommended to avoid the pathogen on seeds. The fungi Acremonium strictum, Dicyma pulvinata, Trichoderma harzianum or T. viride and Trichothecium roseum are antagonistic to M. fulva and could be used to reduce its spread. In greenhouse trials the growth of M. fulva on tomatoes was inhibited by A. strictum, Trichoderma viride strain 3 and T. roseum by 53, 66 and 84% respectively. In small arms, apple-cider, garlic or milk sprays and vinegar mix can be used to treat the mold.

Chemical Control
Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Applications should be made prior to infection when environmental conditions are optimal for the development of the disease. Recommended compounds in field use are chlorothalonil, maneb, mancozeb and copper formulations. For greenhouses, difenoconazole, mandipropamid, cymoxanil, famoxadone and cyprodinil are recommended.
#Tomato;Septoria_Leaf:
Small, water-soaked grey circular spots with dark-brown margins appear on the undersides of older leaves. At later stages of the disease, the spots enlarge and coalesce, and black dots appear in their centers. The same pattern may also be observed on stems and blossoms, but rarely on fruit. Heavily infected leaves will turn slightly yellow, wither, and fall off. The defoliation leads to sun scalding of fruit.
